            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Highly motivated and results-driven Data Scientist with a robust background in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). I bring extensive experience in developing and applying AI methodologies to analyze complex datasets, particularly in the Media and Sustainability sectors. Additionally, I specialize in the creation and curation of datasets for subsequent analysis, ensuring high-quality insights for diverse applications.
Passionate about leveraging AI for positive societal impact, I actively contribute to European projects such as ELIAS, which aims to position Europe as a leader in sustainable AI research. With a strong commitment to social responsibility, I have volunteered for two consecutive summers in Equatorial Guinea, teaching at a local school.
As the Leader of Lausanne-Hub, a global initiative of AI for Good, I am dedicated to fostering an inclusive and sustainable digital future. Alongside my technical expertise and social commitment, I possess strong multilingual capabilities, which enable effective communication and collaboration across diverse teams and contexts.
